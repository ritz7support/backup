# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Implement comprehensive space access control and member management system:
  1. Public Space Join Logic - Allow viewing posts without joining, but require joining to engage (post/comment/react)
  2. Private Spaces with Join Requests - "Request to Join" button, admin/manager approval, show "Request Pending" with cancel option
  3. Member Management per Space - Add/remove/block members, promote to manager role
  4. Space Managers Role - Can moderate content, approve join requests, manage members (but cannot create spaces or edit settings)

      ✅ Updated join request approval to support managers (not just admins)
      ✅ Added membership and blocked checks to create_post, add_comment, react_to_post
      
      **Frontend Changes:**
      ✅ SpaceFeed now shows Join/Request buttons based on space visibility
      ✅ Public spaces: Direct join button

      **Backend Testing Complete - All Tests Passed ✅**
      
      Conducted comprehensive testing of space access control and member management system:
      
      **Test Results Summary:**
      ✅ SpaceMembership Model - Role and blocked fields working correctly
      ✅ Space Manager Helper Functions - Permissions properly scoped
      ✅ GET Spaces - Join request status fields included correctly  
      ✅ Member Management Endpoints - All CRUD operations working
      ✅ Join Request Approval - Manager permissions functioning
      ✅ Post/Comment/React - Blocked users and membership restrictions enforced
      ✅ Membership Requirements - Private space access control working
      
      **Key Findings:**
      - All backend endpoints responding correctly with proper status codes
      - SpaceMembership model includes role (member/manager) and blocked status fields
      - Member management operations (remove, block, unblock, promote, demote) working
      - Manager permissions correctly scoped to specific spaces
      - Blocked users properly prevented from posting/commenting/reacting (403 Forbidden)
      - Non-members cannot engage in private spaces (proper authentication required)
      - Join request approval system working for both admins and managers
      
      **Backend system is fully functional and ready for production use.**
