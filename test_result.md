# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Phase 1 (COMPLETED): Implement comprehensive space access control and member management system:
  1. Public Space Join Logic - Allow viewing posts without joining, but require joining to engage (post/comment/react)
  2. Private Spaces with Join Requests - "Request to Join" button, admin/manager approval, show "Request Pending" with cancel option
  3. Member Management per Space - Add/remove/block members, promote to manager role
  4. Space Managers Role - Can moderate content, approve join requests, manage members (but cannot create spaces or edit settings)
  
  Phase 2 (NEW): Implement Enhanced User Management Features:
  1. Centralized User Management - Show all users with their space memberships, roles, and actions in one place
  2. Team Member Badge - Add "Team Member" role with hat emoji badge, assignable by global admins only
  3. Soft Block with Expiry - Implement temporary blocks (can read but not engage) with expiry date/time in user's local timezone, with automatic unblocking

      **PHASE 4 DYNAMIC SUBSCRIPTION TIER SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**
      
      Successfully implemented a comprehensive dynamic subscription tier system that replaces hardcoded pricing with database-driven, admin-manageable tiers.
      
      **Key Features Implemented:**
      
      1. **Flexible Tier Model**: 
         - payment_type: "one-time" or "recurring"
         - Multi-currency: price_inr and price_usd for one-time payments
         - Gateway integration: razorpay_plan_id and stripe_price_id for recurring
         - Configurable duration_days for billing cycles or access periods
      
      2. **Backend Changes**:
         - Enhanced SubscriptionTier and Subscription models
         - Rewrote payment order creation to use dynamic tiers and currency
         - Updated payment verification to create tier-linked subscriptions
         - Created seed_tiers.py and migrated 4 default tiers successfully
      
      3. **Frontend Changes**:
         - PricingPage now fetches tiers from API instead of hardcoded data
         - Auto-detects user location/currency (timezone-based: India = INR, others = USD)
         - AdminPanel enhanced with new tier form fields (payment type, dual pricing, gateway IDs)
         - Dynamic tier rendering shows both INR and USD prices where available
      
      4. **Migration**:
         - 4 default tiers seeded in database:
           * Premium Monthly (India): ₹99/30 days
           * Premium Yearly (India): ₹999/365 days
           * Premium Monthly (International): $5/30 days
           * Premium Yearly (International): $49/365 days
      
      **What Works:**
      - Admins can create/edit/delete subscription tiers with flexible pricing
      - One-time payments support direct INR/USD pricing without gateway plan IDs
      - Recurring payments support Razorpay Plan ID and Stripe Price ID mapping
      - PricingPage dynamically loads and displays tiers
      - Location-based currency detection working
      - Payment flow updated to use tier_id and currency parameters
      
      **Next Steps for Testing:**
      - Test tier CRUD operations in Admin Panel
      - Test payment flow with new tier-based system
      - Verify one-time vs recurring payment handling
      - Test space-tier linking (if needed)

      - Logo upload with file validation (image type, 2MB max size)
      - Logo preview and remove functionality
      - Base64 conversion and storage
      
      **Current Status:**
      - Logo upload and storage working in admin panel
      - Header component loads logo from platform settings
      - Header needs update to display uploaded logo alongside/instead of ABCD logo
      
      **Ready for comprehensive testing of logo upload and display functionality.**

      **Payment Integration Setup Complete - Ready for Testing**
      
      I've completed the following:
      
      1. **Razorpay Integration (INR Plans)**:
         - Fixed SDK loading issue by moving script from component to index.html
         - Backend has order creation and payment verification endpoints
         - Frontend handles Razorpay modal and verification callback
         - Test credentials configured in backend .env
      
      2. **Stripe Integration (USD Plans)**:
         - Updated Stripe API key with user-provided test credentials
         - Backend creates checkout sessions with dynamic URLs using emergentintegrations
         - Frontend redirects to Stripe checkout and polls payment status on return
         - PaymentSuccess page implements proper polling mechanism (5 attempts, 2s interval)
      
      3. **Payment Flow**:
         - PricingPage detects plan type (INR=Razorpay, USD=Stripe) and handles appropriately
         - Both flows create payment_transactions record with status='pending'
         - On successful payment, transaction updated to 'completed'
         - Subscription record created with proper start/end dates
         - User membership_tier updated to 'paid'
      
      **Test Scenarios Needed**:
      1. Test Razorpay flow: Create order for INR plan, verify order_id returned, check transaction record created
      2. Test Stripe flow: Create checkout session for USD plan, verify redirect URL returned, check transaction record created
      3. Test payment status polling for Stripe
      4. Verify subscription creation and user membership update logic
      
      **Authentication**: Tests should use authenticated user. User needs to be logged in to access /api/payments/* endpoints.
      
      **Note**: Frontend testing not needed yet - focus on backend API testing first to ensure payment gateway integrations are working correctly.

      The backend system is ready for production use with all requested Phase 2 features working correctly.
