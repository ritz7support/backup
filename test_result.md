# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Implement comment functionality and space improvements:
  1. Dynamic Back Button - should navigate to correct space (Introduction, Ask-Doubts, etc.) based on where user came from
  2. Comment Submission UX - no page refresh after adding comment, smooth state update
  3. Comment Editor - support text + images (no rich text), ~3000 character limit (LinkedIn-style)
  4. Make All Spaces Generic - ensure Resources, Showcase, and Discussions work the same as Introduction/Ask-Doubts/Gratitude

      Implemented comment functionality and space improvements as requested:
      
      ✅ CommentEditor Component:
      - Created /app/frontend/src/components/CommentEditor.js
      - Supports text + image upload (no rich text)
      - 3000 character limit with counter (LinkedIn-style)
      - Max image size 5MB, image preview functionality
      
      ✅ Dynamic Back Button:
      - PostDetailPage now receives space name via route state
      - Falls back to API fetch if space name not available
      - Back button shows "Back to [Space Name]" dynamically
      - Works for all spaces generically
      
      ✅ Comment Submission - No Page Refresh:
      - Fixed both PostDetailPage and SpaceFeed quick popup
      - Comments added to state directly (optimistic UI)
      - Post comment_count updated locally
      - No more full page reload after commenting
      
      ✅ All Spaces Generic:
      - Added SPACE_CONFIG for resources, showcase, discussions
      - Updated feedSpaces array to include all 6 spaces
      - All spaces now work consistently
      
      Frontend restarted. Ready for testing to verify:
      1. Comment submission works smoothly without refresh
      2. Images in comments render properly
      3. Back button shows correct space name
      4. All 6 spaces (Introduction, Ask-Doubts, Gratitude, Resources, Showcase, Discussions) work the same way
