The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles an iterative development process on the ABCD community platform, moving from foundational feature enhancements to complex access control and user management. Initially, work focused on improving the RichTextEditor, post viewing (transitioning to ), and navigation (). A major phase involved building an admin interface for space and space group CRUD operations, introducing  models, configurable space types, and granular posting permissions. The core of recent efforts centered on a comprehensive access control system, implementing Public, Private, and Secret spaces with corresponding UI cues (lock/key icons, welcome messages), and the join request flow. Significant debugging was undertaken to resolve frontend rendering issues related to membership status and post creation permissions, leading to a temporary revert and subsequent re-implementation of lost features. The trajectory concludes with backend and frontend work for enhanced user and space manager role management and a commitment to refining UI/UX for confirmation dialogs. Data cleanup and recreation of lost spaces were also critical parts of the process.

The ABCD platform aims to be a Circle.so + Gumroad + Discord hybrid, offering a no-code community solution with user onboarding, pricing, backend-seeded spaces, a collapsible sidebar, and an Events page. Key features include: auto-join for Ask-Doubts spaces with member counts, rich text editor image handling, a dedicated  with a quick comment popup and a rich  (3000-char limit, image support). The admin panel requires CRUD for space groups and spaces, offering ,  visibility, and paid access linked to subscriptions, with intuitive ordering. Spaces should support , , and  types, with member post permissions configurable. Access control requires visual cues (lock/key icons) and customizable . Public spaces should allow non-members to view posts but require joining for engagement, showing a join button. Subsequent requests include a robust Request to Join system for private spaces, admin/manager approval flows, Members tab in Admin Panel for viewing/managing/blocking/promoting members, and a Space Managers role with specific permissions (moderate, approve requests, manage members, but not create/edit spaces). The latest requests involve centralized user management, a Team Member badge, and a Soft Block feature with expiry.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the UI/UX of confirmation dialogs in the Admin Panel. The user reported that Promote to Admin and Make a Manager actions were using unpolished, default browser pop-ups () instead of integrated, styled dialogs.

The AI engineer successfully implemented a custom, polished confirmation dialog component and replaced all instances of  in the  file with this new dialog. This involved:
1.  Adding a new state variable  to  to manage the custom dialog's visibility and content.
2.  Modifying functions like , , , , , , , , , and  to trigger the custom confirmation dialog instead of .
3.  Adding the  component's JSX structure at the end of .

After completing this, the frontend was restarted (, ), and webpack compiled successfully, indicating no syntax errors.

The user then provided new requirements:
1.  **Centralized User Management**: Consolidate all user management (promotion, demotion, blocking, deleting) into one place.
2.  **Team Member Badge**: Introduce a new Team Member role with a visual badge.
3.  **Soft Block with Expiry**: Implement a temporary block feature with an expiry date.

The AI engineer has acknowledged these requests and outlined a plan to implement them. The current work has concluded the polishing of confirmation dialogs, and the focus is now shifting to these new features.
