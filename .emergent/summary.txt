The AI engineer successfully built out significant features for the ABCD community platform. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing existing functionality, including fixing a persistent dropdown issue on the Members page (ResizeObserver error). Subsequently, a robust invite system was implemented, supporting both direct invites and shareable links, and addressing critical session management bugs. UI consistency was a major theme, with the landing, login, and registration pages updated to match the application's dark theme, and generic Coming Soon pages created for various sidebar sections. The latest development centered on creating interactive space pages, starting with Introduction, then generalizing it into a reusable  component, adding rich text editing, image upload, emoji picker, and a member count display, along with backend logic for space configuration and auto-joining members.

The ABCD platform is envisioned as a Circle.so + Gumroad + Discord hybrid for a no-code community, emphasizing a clean, distraction-free experience. Key implemented features include user onboarding (email/password, Google OAuth, role selection), a pricing page, backend-seeded space groups/spaces with a collapsible sidebar, and a functional Events page with calendar, admin event creation/editing, and user registration. A Member Directory allows admin invites and role assignment. UI/UX is consistent with a dark theme, branded colors, and centered top navigation. Recent developments focused on:
1.  **Bug Fixes**: Resolve a persistent dropdown UI issue (ResizeObserver error) on the Members page.
2.  **Invite System**: Implement invite links for different access levels, ensuring admin session persistence during invite, and fixing date/time validation for invite tokens.
3.  **UI Consistency**: Update pre-login pages (Landing, Login, Register) to match the dark theme and implement proper Coming Soon pages for placeholder routes.
4.  **Space Functionality (e.g., Introduction space)**: Enable post creation, reactions, and comments within spaces, with rich text editing, image upload, emoji picker, and link support. Display member counts for spaces. Implement space configuration (Public, Private, Secret, Paid) with auto-join/manual-join options and an admin UI for management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed refactoring the Introduction space functionality into a generic  component (). This component now serves as the base for various community spaces like Introduction, Ask-Doubts, and Gratitude.

Key aspects of this  implementation include:
*   A rich text editor (using ) for post creation, supporting text formatting, image uploads, emojis, and links, with the toolbar positioned at the bottom.
*   Display of member counts in the top right corner of the space.
*   Conditional display of Join Space / Leave Space buttons based on  property and user membership.
*   An integrated feed for posts, reactions, and comments, with dynamic banners and placeholders based on the space's purpose.
*   The  component now dynamically loads space data and renders  with appropriate props for different spaces.

The most recent conversation confirmed that the new generic  is working beautifully across Introduction, Ask-Doubts, and Gratitude spaces, displaying correct UIs, empty states, and consistent member counts. The toolbar for posting is now at the bottom as requested.
