The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the ABCD community platform, moving from foundational features to more complex community management functionalities. Initially, the engineer resolved critical UI/UX issues, including refining the  for image handling, overhauling post viewing (from in-page dialogs to a dedicated  with a quick comment popup), and ensuring consistent navigation (sticky sidebar, dynamic back button).

Subsequently, a significant portion of the work revolved around building a robust admin interface for space and space group management. This included implementing CRUD operations for spaces and groups, introducing  models, and addressing numerous UI glitches related to displaying, ordering, and creating these entities. The engineer also introduced configurable space types (Post, Q&A, Events) and posting permissions. The final phase involved developing a comprehensive access control system with Public, Private, and Secret spaces, dynamic lock/key icons, customizable welcome messages, and initiating the join request flow for restricted spaces. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of public space join logic, allowing read-only access before joining.

The ABCD platform aims to be a Circle.so + Gumroad + Discord hybrid for a no-code community, featuring user onboarding, pricing, backend-seeded spaces, a collapsible sidebar, and an Events page. The recent development trajectory addressed several key areas:

1.  **Ask-Doubts Space Configuration**: Auto-join for users and displaying total community member counts for all open spaces.
2.  **Rich Text Editor Image Handling**: Fix base64 image display, implement image previews, manage size, ensure Post button visibility, and improve feed rendering.
3.  **Post Viewing Experience**: Dedicated sub-page for posts, sticky left navigation sidebar. Later, a quick comment popup with full-page expansion, maintaining the full app layout, and a sticky Back to Introduction button (later made dynamic). Comment editor with image support and a ~3000 character limit.
4.  **Admin Space Management**: Create Space Groups and Spaces (within/without groups). Each group/space needs options for Auto-Join, Public/Private/Secret visibility, and paid access linked to subscriptions. Space/group ordering in the admin panel and sidebar should be intuitive.
5.  **Space Functionality**: Implement different space types (Post, Q&A list view, Events calendar) with corresponding rendering.
6.  **Member Post Permissions**: Option to disable community members from creating posts, allowing only admins/managers to post.
7.  **Access Control Visuals**: Private spaces show a lock icon (unlocked if member/admin), Secret spaces show a key icon for members/admins. Secret spaces are hidden until invited. Customizable welcome messages for spaces.
8.  **Public Space Interaction**: Allow viewing posts in public spaces without joining, but require joining to engage (post/comment/react). Display a join option and appropriate icon.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the logic for **public spaces**. The user requested that for public spaces:
1.  Members should be able to *view* posts even if they haven't officially joined the space (read-only access).
2.  To *engage* (post, comment, react), members must first join the space.
3.  A prominent join button and an appropriate icon (like a plus sign ) should be displayed to indicate the ability to join.

The engineer has started making changes to  to handle the display of public spaces and their join status, and is currently updating  to conditionally show a join button for non-members, allowing them to view content but restricting engagement until they join. The specific goal is to ensure the frontend reflects this read-only access and the mechanism to join public spaces.

Continue updating  to implement the join functionality and restrict engagement for non-members in public spaces.
