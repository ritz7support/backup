The AI engineer's trajectory details an iterative expansion of the ABCD platform, starting with foundational access control and user management. Key developments included a comprehensive access control system for Public, Private, and Secret spaces, incorporating join requests and granular role management (admin, manager, member, blocked). Extensive frontend work was done on  for user and space membership management, including a custom confirmation dialog. Subsequent features involved implementing a profile picture upload system, a gamified leaderboard with points for engagement (posts, comments, likes, joining, profile completion), and configurable levels. The latest work successfully integrated Razorpay for Indian payments, including backend endpoints and frontend UI for subscription. Throughout, the engineer addressed UI/UX feedback, fixed syntax errors, and ensured backend-frontend consistency.

The ABCD platform aims to be a Circle.so + Gumroad + Discord hybrid, offering a no-code community solution with user onboarding, pricing, backend-seeded spaces, a collapsible sidebar, and an Events page. Core features include auto-join Ask-Doubts spaces, rich text editing,  with . The admin panel supports CRUD for space groups/spaces, ,  visibility, and paid access. Spaces support , ,  types, with member post permissions and . Access control includes visual cues, Request to Join for private spaces, and manager approval. User management features include Team Member role with badge, Soft Block with expiry, and centralized user/member management (promote/demote, block/unblock) accessible to Global Admins. Users should be able to upload profile pictures. A Leadership Board with points for likes (1), comments (2), posts (3), joining a space (1), and completing profile picture (5) is required, showing data for 7 days, 30 days, and All Time, with admin-manageable levels. Finally, Razorpay integration for Indian payments is needed.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and integrated Razorpay for Indian payments. This involved:
1.  **Backend Integration**: The  library was confirmed to be installed. Razorpay test credentials ( and ) were added to the  file. A new endpoint  was added to  to securely verify Razorpay payment signatures.
2.  **Frontend Integration**: The existing  was updated to incorporate the new Razorpay verification logic. The  function now calls the new  endpoint with the Razorpay payment details (order_id, payment_id, signature) after a successful payment initiation. A corresponding  method was added to  in .

After these changes, lint checks passed, the backend was restarted, and the system was confirmed to be ready for testing the Razorpay payment flow. The user was provided with specific instructions and URLs to test the Razorpay integration, including test credentials for UPI and card payments.
