Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented the Back to Introduction button on the . This button is strategically positioned at the top-left of the content area, residing just below the main header and alongside the now sticky left sidebar. This enhancement provides improved navigation for users interacting with individual posts. The main application header is consistently displayed with the ABCD branding and user menu, maintaining a unified user experience across the  and other parts of the application. The button itself is a clean white with a shadow, ensuring visibility and user-friendliness. This specific task concluded the refinement of the post viewing experience, which earlier involved the introduction of a quick comment popup for instant interactions and a dedicated  for deeper discussions, both of which are now confirmed as fully functional in terms of display and navigation.
